/**
 * Durable worker leases with renewal and fencing tokens.
 *
 * `utils/lock.ts` acquires a Redis key with a fixed TTL and cannot extend it, so
 * a worker whose job runs longer than the TTL loses the lock without noticing:
 * the key expires, another worker acquires it, and both proceed. This service
 * addresses that with a renewable lease plus a fencing token that makes the
 * loss detectable at the point of the write.
 *
 * ── Why a fencing token and not just renewal ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Renewal narrows the window but cannot close it. A worker can stall — GC
 * pause, blocked syscall, suspended VM — past its expiry, wake up still
 * believing it holds the lease, and write. The token is what makes that
 * harmless: it increases on every acquisition, so the stalled worker's write
 * carries a lower token than the current holder's, and the receiving side
 * rejects it via `isFencedOut`. A lease without a fencing token is a lock that
 * is *usually* exclusive, which is not the same thing.
 *
 * The token lives in PostgreSQL rather than Redis because it has to survive an
 * eviction to be worth anything: a token that restarts at zero silently
 * re-authorises every stale writer.
